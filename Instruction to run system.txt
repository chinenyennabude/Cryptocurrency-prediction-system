Instructions for Runing system

The system is presented on a flask framework and has three menus: "Home," "Predictions," and "Dashboard."
Because streamlit was designed with functionality for this, the 'Dashboard' menu on flak connects to a streamlit for the graphs and other visualisations.
Start streamlit first, then flask.

First run streamlit:

- open the streamlit GUI com724-AE2 folder
- Click on coin.py
- In the terminal, use the code 'pip install Streamlit' to install streamlit
- use the code 'Streamlit run coin.py' to run the app, this will take you to the web browser.

Run flask app:

- open the flask GUI com724-AE2 folder
- Click on app.py
- In the terminal, use the code 'python run app.py' to run, this will take you to the web browser

Now you can navigate the system using the Flask web page.
