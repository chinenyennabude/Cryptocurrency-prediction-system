This project was really challenging but also enlightening, I caried out lots of 
research to understand what and how cryptocurrency works (i.e to gain domain 
Knowledge). Using the concepts of machine learning I was able to develop this 
system that displays trends and predict cryptocurrency price by building a model 
using training data set that has undergone cleaning and transformation. I also used 
statistical and visualization methods to analyse my data set. Although Time 
constraint and some knowledge gaps posed as a limitation in this work, but with 
further learning the system can be further improved on. I gained a lot of 
knowledge while creating this system. # Cryptocurrency-prediction-system
